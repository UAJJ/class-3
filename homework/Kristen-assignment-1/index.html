          <h2> The Paragraphs Were Wrongly Imprisoned </h2>
          <p> Once upon a time there were two paragraphs. These two paragraphs liked to laugh and have a good time. They especially loved to do magic tricks. But these weren't just any magic tricks. These were tricks performed using Javascript. Yes, Javascript. No slight of the hand or trick of the eye, no sawing lovely ladies in fanciful costumes in half, no doves popping out of hats. One day they took their Javascript magic too far. They made a woman disappear on-click using Javascript. But that wasn't all that disappeared. Next thing you know a man disappears and so does a small parrot. They were wrongly accused of kidnapping, found guilty and sent to a div jail. </p>

          <h2> The Paragraphs Make A Break For It </h2>
          <p>Jail was no place for paragraphs. They were used to telling stories, being verbose, and could not tolerate run-on sentences. Within days they were already causing a ruckus with the other inmates. They decided the only solution was to break out, to break free of their div prison. How would they do it? By using their Javascript magic of course! Click on the paragraphs and look at them go! They're making a break for it! Set them free with the magic of Javascript! </p>
